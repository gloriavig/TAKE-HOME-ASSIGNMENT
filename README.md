In this take home assignment that I prepared for class, I used two deep learning methods (YOLO and Faster R-CNN) to analysis 7 images that I had chosen from google. I 
randomly chose this images with no bias. They were random selected for this prodect but I did try to make sure all the images were different in order to analyze the 
results and truely compare the two models with the 7 images that I had used.

I hope you enjoy my results and analysis! :)
